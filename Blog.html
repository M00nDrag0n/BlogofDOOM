    <h2>Be Very Afraid</h2>
    <img src="css-sheet/Doom.webp">
    <p>My favorite trip during summer was one of my notoriously dangerous hikes to the one and only Mt Doom, which is located at the peak of each nightmarish memory inside every boy and girl from <strong>Missouri</strong>.
    <p>The only way to survive such a terrible experience, I have learned, is by overcoming your fear of dragons, lonliness, and fried okra.</p>
    <p>If you are able indeed able to survive the trial, you will be rewarded with pride, strength, resiliance, and <strong>tenacity!</strong></p>
